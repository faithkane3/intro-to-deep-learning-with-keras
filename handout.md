## Keras Workflow
Once you've loaded and prepped your data (meaning it's already a tensor or you've converted your data to be a tensor)
- Create the model
- Add layer(s) with .add
- Compile the model with .compile (to configure the learning parameters)
- Fit the model with .fit
- Evaluate model performance with .evaluate
- Produce predictions on new data with .predict
