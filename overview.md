## Questions

What's the relationsihp betweeen artificial neural networks and real neurons?

What are neural networks and deep learning?

How are artificial neural networks (ANNs) different than other machine learning algorithms?

When should we use ANNs vs. classical machine learning?
- Tremendous volumes of unstructured data? An ANN may be the right tool

The central problem in deep learning is to meaningully transform data to learn useful representations of the input data so those representations get us closer to the desired output.x

What's a representation? A different way to look at data. For example, the RGB representation of "red" is [1, 0, 0] not the string "red".
