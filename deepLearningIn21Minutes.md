# ‚è≥ 21 minute intro to Deep Learning and Keras

## Summary

1. Today you will get an intro to deep learning and run a deep learning neural network üìä¬†
1. You will see that getting started is *accessible* and you don't have to know everything üí≠


### Context
- In classical programming, answers are the product of input data and the explicit rules that programmers program.
- In machine learning, input data and example answers yield the rules we can use on future input data.

## Identify meaningful representations of the data

This figure shows the original data and a new representation. We get new representations of the data by changing our axes to fit the story the data tells. Here we get a new representation of the data in such a way that we can describe data with a simple rule:
<br>
> ‚ÄúBlack points are such that x > 0,‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhite points are such that x < 0.‚Äù

## What is Deep Learning? 
1. Applied linear algebra w/ the latest in hardware. It's just math.
2. The "deep" refers to the number of layers of data transformation used to sift for meaningful representations
3. Deep learning is the application of many different representations of data to identify meaningful relationships in data.
3. The key component of deep learning is comparing predictions vs. true targets, then sending that data through an optimizer that updates weights and runs the inputs with the updated weights.

- In deep learning, we perform many data representations and transformations to compare predictions vs. true targets. The accuracy of the prediction is fed into an optimizer, and the optimizer updates the weights on different layers or features. Then, we run the data through the same layers with updated weights.
- This is the "learning" process: the feeding back of the result of predictions (backpropogation) through an optimization function that updates weights on layers that run on the data again, making for more effective predictions.
- Each layer is the application of geometric transformations of the tensor data

### What Deep Learning is *not*
- How brains function in living things
- Inaccessible mathematics or beyond your undersstanding
- Free from bias and prejudice. (Biased inputs mean biased outputs)


### Vocabulary
- Tensor: a basic data structure in machine learning, a container for data can hold n dimensional matrices, usually numerical data
- Scalar: A tensor that holds only one number  (a zero dimensional tensor)
- Vector: A one dimensional array of numbers (a one dimensional tensor)
- Matrices: An array of vectors. (a two dimensional tensor)
- Tensors are defined by 3 key attributes:
	- Number of axes, rank, or .ndim property. A 3D tensor has 3 axes and a matrix has 2 axes. 
	- Shape - A tuple of integers that describes how many dimen
	- Data type (usually dtype)

### Real Word Tensor Data
- Vector data ‚Äî2D tensors of shape (samples, features)- Timeseries data or sequence data are 3D tensors of shape (samples, timesteps,features)- Images‚Äî4D tensors of shape(samples,height,width,channels)or(samples,channels, height, width)- Video ‚Äî5D tensors of shape (samples, frames, height, width, channels) or(samples, frames, channels, height, width)


## Getting Started Playbook
1. Import mnist data
2. Explore mnist's tensors, visualize w/ matplotlib, make sure you know the shape of the data
3. Run mnist on keras and generate a network.
4. Feed in my own handwritten digits and use the newly generated model to predict
